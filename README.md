## Description:

The **Uriel Code** is a crypto-code created by Uriel-SG in the 2015.

- It's pretty simple, but useful if you need a *quick and friendly* encryption.
- It's easy to use even *without the application* if you understand how it works.


## How does it work?

The method it's really simple: every 'alphanumeric' character corresponds to another.

The correspondence is based on the construction of a cross-shaped drawing.

Example:

"Welcome to cs50!"

> *x 2 o d 9 n 2   4 9   d 5 h 0!*


## PDF Generation

If the user wants, it is possible to print the message in a pdf file with the Uriel Code logo.

## Paranoid Mode

It gives the possibility to **encode** the encrypt message with the base64 method and *viceversa*.

Example:

"Welcome to CS50!"
The program will automatically encrypt the string ("x 2 o d 9 n 2   4 9   d 5 h 0!"), and then:
